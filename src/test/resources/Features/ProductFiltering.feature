  As a shopper
  I want to filter products on the e-commerce website
  So that I can easily find the items that match my preferences

  Scenario: Filter Products by Name (A to Z)
    Given the user is on the product listing page
    When the user selects a specific filter from the filter options
    Then the user should see the filtered products

  Scenario: Filter Products by Price (low to high)
    Given the user is on the product listing page
    When the user sets a price filter (low to high)
    Then the user should see a list of products ordered from the lowest till the highest price
    And all displayed products should have prices

  Scenario: Clearing Filters
    Given the user has applied filters on the product listing page
    When the user clicks on the selected filter button
    Then the user should see the full list of products
    And no filters should be applied

  Scenario: Persisting Filters on Navigation
    Given the user has applied filters on the product listing page
    When the user navigates to a different page and returns
    Then the applied filters should persist
    And the user should see the filtered list of products
